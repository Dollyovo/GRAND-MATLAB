Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND)

Subject to license:
"GRAND Codebase Non-Commercial Academic Research Use License 021722.pdf"

Non-parallelized MATLAB implementations of: GRAND (hard detection); basic ORBGRAND (soft detection); 1-line ORBGRAND (soft detection).

Simulation is setup and run with GRAND_Code/driver_GRAND.m

Sample output is in RESULTS, and sample plots from those results can be made with MAKE_FIGS/driver_sample_figs.m

Note that for an [n,k] code, where k information bits become n coded bits, GRAND algorithms accurately and efficiently decode codes where n-k is moderate. This MATLAB implementation is solely intended to be instructive and is not parallelised, even though highly-parallelised implementations are possible. As a result, obtaining the full performance of a code with n-k>16 may prove time-consuming with the present implementation.
